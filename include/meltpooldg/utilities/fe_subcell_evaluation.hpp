   * ## General Description
   *
   * This class transfers a finite element solution on a matrix-free cell batch to a finite volume
   * subcell representation and back. Each cell is split into subcells that are associated
   * one-to-one with the quadrature points of the underlying dealii::FEEvaluation object, following
   * Sonntag and Munz [1]:
   *
   * - DG to FV (evaluate()): the DG solution is evaluated at the quadrature points, and the value
   *   at quadrature point `q` is taken as the mean value of subcell `q`. The subcell
   *   volume is the corresponding quadrature weight times the Jacobian determinant. Note that the
   *   mean values used here are actually not the exact mean values ver the corresponding subcells
   *   but as shown in [1], this choice can be justified as it still guarantees conservation.
   * - FV to DG (integrate()): the subcell values submitted via submit_value() and the fluxes over
   *   the intra cell subcell faces submitted via submit_flux() are combined into one value per
   *   subcell. Each flux is multiplied by the face size and divided by the subcell size, and then
   *   added to the interior subcell and subtracted from the exterior subcell of its face. The
   *   result is then transformed back to the DG coefficients. To provide a more convenient
   *   interface, integrate_scatter() additionally adds these coefficients to the global solution
   *   vector.
   *
   * Without fluxes, both transformations are inverse to each other and preserve the cell integral
   * if the quadrature integrates the DG solution exactly. Since every flux enters its two adjacent
   * subcells with opposite signs, the fluxes do not change the cell integral either.
   *
   * The class does not compute any fluxes itself. Instead, it provides access to the subcell
   * values, gradients and sizes as well as to the values, sizes and normal vectors of the intra
   * cell subcell faces, i.e. the faces shared by two subcells of the same cell. The fluxes over the
   * subcell faces on the boundary of the DG cell are handled by FESubcellFaceEvaluation in the
   * matrix-free face loop. To integrate seamlessly with the deal.II matrix-free framework, the
   * interface of this class mirrors that of dealii::FEEvaluation whenever possible.
   *
   * ## Subcell Indexing and Face Ordering
   *
   * For most of the normal use cases of this class, the ordering of the subcells and the subcell
   * faces should not be relevant. However, for the case that you anyway need to know them or you
   * work on the internals of the class, here is a short description of the ordering of both the
   * subcells and the intra cell subcell faces.
   *
   * The subcells are numbered lexicographically with the x-index varying fastest, i.e. in the
   * same order as the quadrature points. The example below shows a two-dimensional cell with
   * `n_subcells_1d == 4`. In general, the subcell widths follow the quadrature weights and are not
   * equidistant.
   *
   * @verbatim
       y
       ^
       |   +------+------+------+------+
       |   |  12  |  13  |  14  |  15  |
       |   +------+------+------+------+
       |   |   8  |   9  |  10  |  11  |
       |   +------+------+------+------+
       |   |   4  |   5  |   6  |   7  |
       |   +------+------+------+------+
       |   |   0  |   1  |   2  |   3  |
       |   +------+------+------+------+
       +----------------------------------> x
   * @endverbatim
   *
   * In a three-dimensional cell, the above sketch would show the cells in the x-y plane with z
   * being zero, i.e. the first layer in the z-direction. The next layer in the z-direction would
   * then be numbered 16 to 31, where cell 16 would sit in the bottom-left corner of the layer and
   * so on.
   *
   * The intra cell subcell faces are numbered in a similar way, but the faces are grouped by their
   * normal orientation `d`: first all faces normal to the x-direction, then those normal to the
   * y-direction, and in 3D those normal to the z-direction. With `n = n_subcells_1d`, each group
   * holds `(n - 1) * n^(dim - 1)` faces. Within a group, a face is identified by the indices of its
   * interior subcell in all directions, where the index in its normal direction `d` runs from `0`
   * to `n - 2` and all others from `0` to `n - 1`. The faces are numbered lexicographically in
   * these indices with the x-index varying fastest.
   *
   * As it is common in DG and FV methods, we also use the definition of interior and exterior
   * subcells. The interior subcell of a face is the subcell below the face in its normal direction
   * `d`, the exterior subcell the one above. Thus, the index of the exterior subcell is the index
   * of the interior subcell plus `n^d`. As for dealii::FEFaceEvaluation, the normal vector points
   * out of the interior subcell, i.e. into the exterior subcell in the direction of increasing
   * reference coordinate `d`.
   *
   * To better illustrate this, let's consider a short example. Below you find a sketch of a
   * two-dimensional case with `n == 3` including the subcell and face numbering:
   *
   * @verbatim
         subcells        faces normal to x   faces normal to y
      +---+---+---+       +---+---+---+       +---+---+---+
      | 6 | 7 | 8 |       |   4   5   |       |   |   |   |
      +---+---+---+       +---+---+---+       +-9-+-10+-11+
      | 3 | 4 | 5 |       |   2   3   |       |   |   |   |
      +---+---+---+       +---+---+---+       +-6-+-7-+-8-+
      | 0 | 1 | 2 |       |   0   1   |       |   |   |   |
      +---+---+---+       +---+---+---+       +---+---+---+
   * @endverbatim
   *
   * For example, face 3 has the interior subcell 4 and the exterior subcell 5, and face 7 has
   * the interior subcell 1 and the exterior subcell 4.
   *
   * @note The above description already shows a limitation of the current implementation: For
   * physical cells that are rotated e.g. by 180° into the reference coordinates the returned normal
   * vectors of subcell_face_normal_vector() point in the wrong direction. This is because the
   * current implementation assumes that the reference coordinate directions coincide with the real
   * ones. This is the case for Cartesian cells, but not for rotated cells. The current
   * implementation therefore only supports Cartesian cells.
   *
   * ## Usage Example
   *
   * Let's have a short look on how this class can be used. The following example shows the cell
   * part of a finite volume operator on the subcells within a matrix-free cell loop:
   *
   * @code
   * FESubcellEvaluation<dim, n_components, double> phi(matrix_free, dof_no, quad_no);
   *
   * for (unsigned int cell = cell_range.first; cell < cell_range.second; ++cell)
   *   {
   *     phi.reinit(cell);
   *     phi.gather_evaluate(src, dealii::EvaluationFlags::values);
   *
   *     for (const unsigned int f : phi.subcell_face_indices())
   *       {
   *         const auto flux = numerical_flux(phi.get_face_value(f, true),
   *                                          phi.get_face_value(f, false),
   *                                          phi.subcell_face_normal_vector(f));
   *         phi.submit_flux(f, -flux);
   *       }
   *
   *     phi.integrate_scatter(dst);
   *   }
   * @endcode
   *
   * Exactly one flux is submitted per intra cell subcell face. integrate() adds it, multiplied by
   * the face size and divided by the subcell size, to the interior subcell and subtracts it from
   * the exterior subcell. Hence, as on the interior side of FESubcellFaceEvaluation, a flux in the
   * direction of the normal vector has to be submitted with a negative sign. The subcell faces on
   * the boundary of the DG cell are not handled by this class. Their fluxes are submitted in the
   * face loop using FESubcellFaceEvaluation, and both loops together add the complete finite
   * volume right-hand side to `dst`.
   *
   * If the subcell values themselves are to be modified, e.g. by a limiter, they are submitted
   * with submit_value() instead, and the resulting DoF values overwrite the ones in `dst`:
   *
   * @code
   * for (unsigned int cell = cell_range.first; cell < cell_range.second; ++cell)
   *   {
   *     phi.reinit(cell);
   *     phi.gather_evaluate(src, dealii::EvaluationFlags::values);
   *
   *     for (const unsigned int q : phi.subcell_indices())
   *       phi.submit_value(q, limit(phi.get_value(q)));
   *
   *     phi.integrate();
   *     phi.set_dof_values(dst);
   *   }
   * @endcode
   *
   * If both values and fluxes are submitted on the same cell, integrate() adds the flux
   * contributions to the submitted values.
